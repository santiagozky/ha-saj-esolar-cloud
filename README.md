A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for SAJ eSolar cloud service, providing detailed monitoring of H1 inverters with battery storage systems.

This integration is a complete rewrite focused on H1 inverters with battery storage, using the modern Elekeeper cloud API. The "Cloud" suffix denotes its cloud-based nature and distinguishes it from other SAJ eSolar integrations.
It started as a fork of [SAJeSolar](https://github.com/djansen1987/SAJeSolar) by @djansen1987, and has since been fully rewritten for current API behavior and hardware targets, so the current codebase no longer shares code with the original project.

## 🚀 Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=elboletaire&repository=ha-saj-esolar-cloud&category=integration)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/elboletaire/ha-saj-esolar-cloud`
6. Select category: "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "SAJ eSolar Cloud" in the integrations list and install it
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/saj_esolar_cloud` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to Home Assistant's **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click the **"+ Add Integration"** button
3. Search for **"SAJ eSolar Cloud"**
4. Enter your eSolar Portal credentials:
   - **Username**: Your eSolar Portal username
   - **Password**: Your eSolar Portal password
   - **Region**: Select your region (EU, India, or China)

### Plant Selection

5. **Select Plants**: Choose which solar installations to monitor
   - ✅ Multi-select support for multiple plants
   - 🏭 Each plant becomes a separate device
   - 🔋 Individual batteries automatically detected

### Reconfiguration

- Use **"Configure"** button in the integration to modify monitored plants
- Add or remove plants without reinstalling the integration

## 🏷️ OEM Backend Notes

- Region `gh` (Greenheiss):
  - Base API domain: `https://eop.greenheiss.com/dev-api/api/v1`
  - `appProjectName`: `oem4Greenheiss`
- Other regions (`eu`, `in`, `cn`):
  - Keep original SAJ `appProjectName`: `elekeeper`
- Authentication and request signing are unchanged.

## 🔀 SEC vs H1 Query Mode

- For SEC plants (`queryDeviceDataType = 2`), statistics and energy flow endpoints are queried with `emsSn`.
- For non-SEC plants, the integration keeps the legacy `deviceSn` query behavior.
- Device list and related endpoints use the plant `officeId` for `searchOfficeIdArr` when available.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 🔋 **Battery Health Calculation**
- Realistic health percentages based on degradation
- Formula: `Health = 100 - Degradation`
- Accounts for natural battery aging over time

### 📊 **Rich Sensor Attributes**

- Proper technical terminology for solar/battery systems

### 🔄 **Smart Data Mapping**
- **System-level data**: Aggregated values for total system monitoring
- **Individual data**: Per-battery metrics for detailed analysis
- **Calculated values**: Intelligent distribution of system data across batteries

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No data showing:**
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check if your region is properly selected
- Ensure your inverter is online in the eSolar portal

**Missing batteries:**
- Battery devices appear automatically if detected
- Check if batteries are properly configured in eSolar portal
- Restart Home Assistant after battery installation

**Incorrect values:**
- Integration uses real-time API data
- Values may differ slightly from eSolar portal due to timing
- Check "Last Update" sensor for data freshness

## 📈 Energy Dashboard Integration

All sensors are properly configured for Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard:
- ✅ **Solar Production**: Today/Month/Year Generation
- ✅ **Grid Consumption**: Grid Import sensors
- ✅ **Grid Return**: Grid Export sensors
- ✅ **Battery Storage**: Battery Charge/Discharge sensors
- ✅ **Home Consumption**: Load consumption sensors
